Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
The script can be used for candidates to curate their political messages to certain audiences. For example, if Denver county has the most people, a prospective political candidate could pay more attention to that particular county of the smaller ones. Furthermore, the script could be used to create charts to visualize the electio results (i.e. pie charts, etc).
